# Xenomorph Park - Game Design Document

## Game Overview

**Title:** Xenomorph Park
**Genre:** Park Management & Survival Horror
**Platform:** Web Browser
**Target Audience:** 16+ (Sci-Fi Horror Themes)
**Development Status:** Complete

### Core Concept
Xenomorph Park is a unique hybrid game that combines the strategic depth of park management simulation with the tension of survival horror. Players must balance the delicate act of running a profitable xenomorph exhibition park while maintaining containment and visitor safety. When containment fails, the game seamlessly transitions from management to survival horror.

## Game Modes

### Building Mode (Primary Gameplay)
The core management simulation where players construct, manage, and optimize their xenomorph park.

**Key Activities:**
- Facility construction and layout planning
- Resource management (Credits, Power, Research, Visitors)
- Xenomorph research and acquisition
- Visitor satisfaction and revenue optimization
- Crisis management and containment protocols

### Horror Survival Mode (Secondary Gameplay)
Activated during containment breaches or by player choice. The perspective shifts to first-person survival horror.

**Key Activities:**
- Combat against escaped xenomorphs
- Objective-based missions (evacuation, containment restoration)
- Resource scavenging (ammunition, health items)
- Atmospheric horror experience with limited visibility
