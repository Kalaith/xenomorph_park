# Unimplemented Features - Xenomorph Park

Based on analysis of the current implementation compared to `FRONTEND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`, here are the remaining features that are **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**:

## **Minor Missing Features**

### **Visual & Audio Effects**
- **Particle effects using CSS/Canvas** for containment breaches
- **Weather and lighting effects** using CSS filters
- **Camera controls (zoom, pan)** for larger grid navigation
- **Visual feedback for resource changes** (floating numbers)

### **User Interface Enhancements**
- **Drag-and-drop facility placement** with preview
- **Undo/redo functionality** for building actions
- **Right-click context menus** for facilities and xenomorphs
- **Grid snap and alignment helpers**

### **Information Display**
- **Real-time mini-charts** for resource trends using Canvas/SVG (partially implemented)
- **Interactive tutorial mode** with guided steps
- **Tooltip system** with rich information on hover
- **Status bar** with quick resource overview
- **Facility connection visualizations** (power lines, etc.)

### **Game Systems**
- **Genetic modification interface** for xenomorph breeding
- **Species-specific behavior animations** and effects
- **Breeding interface** with genetic combination preview
- **Pack hunting visualization** for escaped xenomorphs
- **Lifecycle progression** with visual stages

### **Performance & Architecture**
- **Virtual scrolling** for large grids
- **Canvas-based rendering** for complex grid operations

### **Responsive Design**
- **Swipe gestures** for mobile navigation
- **Collapsible side panels** for smaller screens

### **Content Expansion**
- **Medical bay component** with injury treatment interface
- **Cafeteria** with visitor satisfaction metrics
- **Waste management system** with pollution tracking
- **Observatory** for monitoring weather and external threats

### **Additional Xenomorph Species**
- **Queen xenomorph** with special breeding interface
- **Facehugger containment** with lifecycle timers
- **Chestburster emergence** event animations
- **Alien variants** with unique visual designs and abilities

### **Game Modes**
- **Sandbox mode toggle** with unlimited resources
- **Challenge scenarios** with objective tracking
- **Speedrun mode** with countdown timer
- **Different difficulty settings** with modified game rules

## **Summary**

**EXCELLENT NEWS**: Almost everything from the improvements document is already implemented! The current codebase includes:

âœ… **Fully Implemented:**
- Complete horror survival mode with movement and combat
- Time progression system with day/night cycles
- Resource management with dynamic calculations
- Research tree (changed from original plan to skill tree)
- Crisis event system with meaningful consequences
- Enhanced save/load system using localStorage
- Settings modal with preferences
- Notification system with toast notifications
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Achievement system with unlock tracking
- Visual feedback and animations
- Accessibility features (high contrast, screen reader support)
- Mobile optimization
- All core UI components listed in the improvements

**MINOR MISSING**: Only small polish features remain:
- Some advanced visual effects (particles, weather)
- Enhanced user interactions (drag-drop, undo/redo)
- Additional content (new facilities, species)
- Advanced performance optimizations

The game is essentially **feature-complete** based on the original improvement plan!
